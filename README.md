🎓 I'm a computer science and engineering student @ Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon.

📚 I'm interested in learning about everything. However, my current interests reside around algorithms, compilers and machine learning.

💡 Here are some fun facts about me:
  - I love ramen;
  - My favorite sorting algorithm is StalinSort. Out of place? Get erased;
